# PC-Lockout

I spend too much time on my computer, so I wrote this simple script to help me get some time away.

## How It Works
The program automatically locks my PC every night at 7 PM until 8 PM. It gives two warning signals: one siren five minutes before, and two sirens ten seconds before the lock. It’s not perfect, depending on when the program starts, it can lock anywhere between 7:00 and 7:05 PM but it’s good enough to get me outside. :)
